Develop a web application based on JSP (Java Server Pages) or Java Servlets.

All web pages should be accessible only if the user logs in using a username and a password (create a session each time a user logs in, and destroy the session when the user logs out). Have in mind the user experience when you implement the problem:

	add different validation logic for input fields
	do not force the user to input an ID for an item if he wants to delete/edit/insert it; this should happen automatically (e.g. the user clicks an item from a list, and a page/modal prepopulated with the data for that particular item is opened, where the user can edit it)
	add confirmation when the user deletes/cancels an item
	do a bare minimum CSS that at least aligns the various input fields

Solve the following problem using the JSP/Servlet technology. 
State information (between web requests) is always stored in a database; you may store some state information in cookies/session objects. 
Write a web application which allows two (human) players to play the game X-0. 
The game can not start unless two playes are connected. 
If a third player comes in, it will be rejected from the game with an error message. 
Users must authenticate themselfs prior to entering the game (based on username/password).
