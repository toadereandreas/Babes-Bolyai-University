<dl>
  <dh>accessible</dh><dd>A vertex <i>y</i> is <i>accessible</i> from <i>x</i> if there
    exists at least one walk starting at <i>x</i> and ending at <i>y</i>. As walks of
    length 0 are valid, this means that each vertex is accessible from itself</dd>
  <dh>adjacency</dh><dd>vertex <i>y</i> is adjecent to vertex <i>x</i>
    if there is an edge from <i>x</i> to <i>y</i></dd>
  <dh>closed walk</dh><dd>a walk that starts and ends in the same vertex.</dd>
  <dh>connected component</dh><dd>a subset of the set of vertices, so that each vertex
    in the subset is accessible from each vertex of the subset, and which
    is maximal (there is no proper superset with the same property).
    The <i>connected component</i> term is used only for undirected graphs;
    for a directed graph, the same concept is called <i>strongly connected
    component.</i></dd>
  <dh>cost of a walk</dh><dd>the sum of the costs of the edges that form that walk.
    Note that a zero length walk has a cost of zero.</dd>
  <dh>cycle</dh><dd>a closed walk of length at least 1, with no other repeating vertices
    except for the fact that the first is the same as the last, and with no repeating
    edges. In an undirected graph, this means that a cycle has the length at least
    3.</dd>
  <dh>incidency</dh><dd>vertex <i>x</i> is incident to edge <i>e</i> if
    <i>x</i> is an endpoint of <i>e</i></dd>
  <dh>length of a walk</dh><dd>the number of edges along the walk, or, equivalently,
    the number of vertices minus one.</dd>
  <dh>path</dh><dd>A walk with no repeating vertices</dd>
  <dh>strongly connected component</dh><dd>see <i>connected component</i></dd>
  <dh>walk</dh><dd>A sequence of 1 or more vertices,
    <i>(x<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>1</sub>,...,x<sub>k</sub>)</i> such that each vertex
    has an edge to the next one. The <i>length</i> of the walk is the number of
    edges along it, or, equivalently, the number of vertices minus one. Repeating
    vertices or edges are allowed. A walk of length 0 is allowed; it has a single
    vertex (so the starting vertex is the same as the destination vertex) and zero
    edges.</dd>
