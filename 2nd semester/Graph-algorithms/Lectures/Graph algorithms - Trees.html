<h2>Definition and properties</h2>
<p><b>Definition:</b> A <i>tree</i> is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles</p>

<a few="" notes:<ul="">
  <li>We understand by <i>cycle</i> a closed walk with no repeating vertices (except that the
    first and the last vertex are the same) and no repeating edges. This means that, if there
    is an edge between vertices 1 and 2, the walk (1, 2, 1) is not a cycle because it uses the
    same edge twice (once in each direction).
  </li><li>The smalles tree that fits the definition consists in a single isolated vertex.
  </li><li>There is a big difference between <i>non-rooted trees</i> considered here and the
    <i>rooted trees</i> used especially for data structures. Any tree becomes a rooted tree
    by distinguishing any of its vertices as root and directing all edges away from the root.
    Viceversa, any rooted tree becomes a non-rooted tree if we forget the distinguished vertex
    and the parent-child direction of edges.
  </li></a><li><a few="" notes:<ul="">For data structures, we most often distinguish an order among the children of a vertex.
    Thus, there are rooted tree with no order among children (we simply have a root and all
    edges directed away from it), and rooted tree with order on children (where, in addition,
    we distinguish an order among the children). For binary trees, in addition, we sometimes
    distinguish between a node with only a left child and a node with only a right child
    (this is the case for binary search trees, for example). All these kind of trees are distinct.
    Bottom line: trees studied here are non-rooted and there is no order among the neighbours
    of any given node.


<p>Equivalent properties for an undirected graph:</p><ol>
  <li>The graph is a tree;
  </li><li>The graph is connected and has at most <i>n-1</i> edges (where <i>n</i> is the
    number of vertices);
  </li><li>The graph has no cycles and has at least <i>n-1</i> edges;
  </li><li>The graph is connected and minimal (if we remove any edge, it becomes non-connected);
  </li><li>The graph has no cycles and is maximal (if we add any edge, it closes a cycle);
  </li><li>For any pair of vertices, there is a unique path connecting them.
</li></ol><p></p>

<h2>The minimum spanning tree problem</h2>

<p>Given a graph with non-negative costs, find a tree with the same vertices and a subset of
the edges of the original graph (a <i>spanning tree</i>) of minimum total cost.</p>

<p>There are two well-known algorithms for solving this problem: Kruskal's algorithm and
Prim's algorithm.Kruskal's algorithm

</p><h4>Idea</h4>

<p>The idea is to start with a graph with all the vertices and no edges, and then to
add edges that do not close cycles. This way, as the algorithm progresses, the graph
will consist in small trees (it will be what is called a <i>forest</i> - a graph
with no cycles, meaning that its connected components are trees), and those trees are
joined together to form fewer and larger trees, until we have a single tree spanning
all the vertices. In doing all the above, we use the edges in increasing order of their cost.</p>

<h4>The basic algorithm</h4>

<pre>Input:
    G : undirected graph with costs
Output:
    edges : a collection of edges, forming a minimum cost spanning tree
Algorithm:
    e<sub>0</sub>,...,e<sub>m-1</sub> = list of edges sorted increasing by cost
    edges = &#8709;
    for i from 0 to m-1 do
        if edges &#8746; {e<sub>i</sub>} has no cycles then
            edges.add(e<sub>i</sub>)
        end if
    end for
</pre>

<h4>Issue with the basic algorithm</h4>

<p>The difficult part here is how to test the existence of cycles. There is a much easier way:
to keep track of the connected components of <tt>edges</tt>, and to notice that a cycle is formed
when adding a new edge if and only if the endpoints of the edge are in the same component.</p>

<p>Keeping track of the connected components is an interesting problem in itself.</p>

<p>TBD</p>

<h4>Proof of correctness</h4>

<p>The proof is a clasical proof for a greedy algorithm: we compare the Kruskal's solution with
the optimal solution for the problem, find the first difference, and modify the optimal solution,
without loosing the optimality, so that to match better the Kruskal's solution. By repeating the
above step, we turn the optimal solution into Kruskal's solution without loosing the optimality,
thus proving that Kruskal's solution is optimal.</p>

<h3>Prim's algorithm</h3>

<h4>Idea</h4>

<p>Prim's algorithm is similar to Kruskal's algorithm; however, instead of starting with lots of
trees and joining them together, Prim's algorithm starts with a single tree consisting in
a single vertex, and then grows it until it covers all the vertices. At each step, an edge
is added, connecting an exterior vertex to the tree. Among all the edges connecting
a vertex outside the tree with one in the tree, it is choosen the edge of smallest cost.</p>

<h4>The algorithm</h4>

<pre>Input:
    G : directed graph with costs
Output:
    edges : a collection of edges, forming a minimum cost spanning tree
Algorithm:
    PriorityQueue q
    Dictionary prev
    Dictionary dist
    edges = &#8709;
    choose s in X arbitrarily
    vertices = {s}
    for x in N(x) do
        dist[x] = cost(x, s)
        prev[x] = s
        q.enqueue(x, d[x])              // second argument is priority
    while not q.isEmpty() do
        x = q.dequeue()      // dequeues the element with minimum value of priority
        if x &#8713; vertices then
            edges.add({x, prev[x]})
            vertices.add(x)
            for y in N(x) do
                if y not in dist.keys() or cost(x,y) &lt; dist[y] then
                    dist[y] = cost(x, y)
                    q.enqueue(y, dist[y])
                    prev[y] = x
                end if
            end for
        end if
    end while
