<h1><center>Graph algorithms - Dijkstra's algorithm</center></h1>

<h2>Problem</h2>
Given a graph with non-negative costs and two vertices <i>s</i> and <i>t</i>,
find a minimum cost walk from <i>s</i> to <i>t</i>.

<h2>Idea</h2>

<p>Dijkstra's algorithm still relies on Bellman's optimality principle; however, it computes
distances from the starting vertex in increasing order of the distances. This way, the distance
from start to a given vertex doesn't have to be recomputed after the vertex is processed.</p>

<p>This way, Dijkstra's algorithm looks a bit like the breadth-first traversal; however,
the queue is replaced by a priority queue where the top vertex is the closest to the starting
vertex.</p>

<h2>The algorithm</h2>

<pre>Input:
    G : directed graph with costs
    s, t : two vertices
Output:
    dist : a map that associates, to each accessible vertex, the cost of the minimum
            cost walk from s to it
    prev : a map that maps each accessible vertex to its predecessor on a path from s to it
Algorithm:
    PriorityQueue q
    Dictionary prev
    Dictionary dist
    q.enqueue(s, 0)              // second argument is priority
    dist[s] = 0
    found = false
    while not q.isEmpty() and not found do
        x = q.dequeue()      // dequeues the element with minimum value of priority
        for y in Nout(x) do
            if y not in dist.keys() or dist[x] + cost(x,y) &lt; dist[y] then
                dist[y] = dist[x] + cost(x, y)
                q.enqueue(y, dist[y])
                prev[y] = x
            end if
        end for
        if x == t then
            found = true
        endif
    end while
</pre>

<ul>
  <li>If all costs are non-negative, the algorithm above doesn't put a vertex into
    the priority queue once it was extracted and processed (see proof below).
  </li><li>If there are negative costs, but no negative cost cycles, then a vertex may be
    processed multiple times. However, if we eliminate the exit on dequeueing the target vertex,
    the algorithm finishes after a finite number of steps and the result is correct.
  </li><li>If there is a negative cost cycle accessible from the starting vertex, then the
    algoritm can end with an incorrect result or it can run forever.
</li></ul>

<h2>Proof of correctness (for non-negative costs)</h2>

<h3>Non-negative costs case</h3>
<p>
We claim that, when a vertex is dequeued from the priority queue,
its <tt>dist</tt> is equal to the cost of the minimum cost walk from the start to it.
</p>
<p>
Suppose the contrary. Let <i>x</i> be the first vertex for which the above statement is false.
So, we have that <i>dist[x]</i> is strictly smaller than the cost of the minimum cost walk from
<i>s</i> to <i>x</i>.</p>

<p>Let <i>S</i> be the set of vertices that were in the priority queue and
have already been dequeued from it when <i>x</i> gets dequeued (<i>x&#8713;S</i>).
On the best walh from <i>s</i> to <i>x</i> the vertex just before <i>x</i> cannot be in <i>S</i>,
otherwise <i>dist[x]</i> would have been correctly computed when that vertex was dequeued.</p>

<p>So, let <i>(y,z)</i> be the first edge on the minimum cost walk from <i>s</i> to <i>x</i>
that exists <i>S</i>.</p>

<p>In the image below, the upper walk is the minimum cost walk, and the lower one is the
one found by the algorithm, and implied by the values of <i>dist</i> and <i>prev</i>.</p>

<img src="./Graph algorithms - Dijkstra&#39;s algorithm_files/dijkstra-proof.svg">

<p>However, since <i>x</i> is at the top of the priority queue and not <i>z</i>,
we have that <i>cost(s,...,y,z) &#8805; cost(s,...,x)</i> and, since all edges have non-negative costs,
<i>cost(z,...,x) &#8805; 0</i>. Therefore, the bottom walk, found by the algorithm, cannot have a
larger cost than the minimum cost walk, which prove our claim.</p>
