Lab 5: Heap
Implement a C++ application for solving the given problem using as data structure a heap. If no further specification is given, use a binary heap. You are not allowed to use STL vector or other container/data structure from STL or other libraries for the implementation of the heap.
The problems will be solved in two-member teams (formed during the lab). Each member of the team will receive the same grade for the assignment.

8. Implement a container, called ADT ThirdPriorityQueue which is similar to a PriorityQueue, but returns and removes the element with the third highest priority (considering a relation R over the priorities). Use a binary heap as representation.
