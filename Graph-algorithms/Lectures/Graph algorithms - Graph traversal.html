<h1><center>Graph algorithms - graph traversal</center></h1>

<h2>Problem</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Given a starting vertex <i>s</i>, find all vertices that are accessible from it;
  </li><li>Additionally, find a path, or a minimum length path, from the starting vertex
    to a given destination vertex;
</li></ul>

<h2>Breadth-first traversal algorithm</h2>

The algorith below visits all the vertices that are accessible from the start vertex.
They are visited in the order of increasing distances from the starting vertex.
A <i>previous</i> vector or map is computed, allowing us to compute the minimum length
path from the starting vertex to any choosen accessible vertex.

<pre>Input:
    G : graph
    s : a vertex
Output:
    accessible : the set of vertices that are accessible from s
    prev : a map that maps each accessible vertex to its predecessor on a path from s to it
Algorithm:
    Queue q
    Dictionary prev
    Dictionary dist
    Set visited
    q.enqueue(s)
    visited.add(s)
    dist[s] = 0
    while not q.isEmpty() do
        x = q.dequeue()
        for y in Nout(x) do
            if y not in visited then
                q.enqueue(y)
                visited.add(y)
                dist[y] = dist[x] + 1
                prev[y] = x
            end if
        end for
    end while
    accessible = visited
</pre>


<h2>Accessibility - proof of correctness</h2>

The proof comes in 3 parts:<ol>
  <li>All returned vertices are accessible,
  </li><li>The algorithm finishes,
  </li><li>All accessible vertices are returned.
</li></ol>

<p>
1. When a vertex is put into the queue, it is also put into the visited set, and no
vertex is ever removed from the visited set, so any vertex in the queue is also in
the visited set.
</p><p>
Next, we claim that, at each iteration,
all vertices in the visited set are accessible
from the start. At the beginning, this is true, because only the starting vertex is
in the visited set. Next, a vertex is put in the visited set only if it is the outbound
neighbour of a vertex in the queue; that vertex is therefore in the visited set and so
it is accessible from start, so the added vertex is also accessible from start.

</p><p>
2. A vertex added to the queue only if not already in the visited set;
it is also added in the visited set and never removed. So, any vertex gets at most once
in the queue. So, the algorithm finishes in at most <i>n</i> iterations of the
main loop. At each iteration, the inner loop executes outdeg(x) times, which sums up,
on all iterations, to the total number of edges. So, the algorithm runs in
<i>O(n+m)</i>.

</p><p>
3. Suppose, by contradiction, that there is a vertex <i>y</i> accessible from <i>s</i>
(start), but which is not in the visited set at the end. Since <i>y</i> is accessible
from <i>s</i>, there is a path
<i>(s=x<sub>0</sub>,x<sub>1</sub>,...,x<sub>k</sub>=y)</i> from <i>s</i> to <i>y</i>.
On that path, there must be a first vertex that is not visited, so, there is an
<i>i</i> such that <i>x<sub>i</sub></i> is visited and <i>x<sub>i+1</sub></i> is
not visited.
</p><p>
This means that there was a moment when <i>x<sub>i</sub></i> was visited and
added to the queue, and, at a later time, there was an iteration when 
<i>x<sub>i</sub></i> was processed. At that moment, <i>x<sub>i+1</sub></i>
was discovered as an unvisited neighbour of <i>x<sub>i</sub></i> and added to the
visited set, which contradicts the hypothesis.
</p><p>
3'. (alternative) We claim that, at each iteration, for any vertex <i>x</i>
accessible from start, either <i>x</i> is in the visited set, or there is a walk
going from start to <i>x</i> that has a vertex in the queue and that vertex is
followed only by vertices not in the visited set.
</p><p>
The above condition is true in the beginning. When going from one iteration to the next,
there are two changes: the top vertex is extracted from the queue, and its neighbours are
inserted into the queue and into the visited set.
</p><p>
If <i>(s=x<sub>0</sub>,...,x<sub>j</sub>,x<sub>j+1</sub>,...,x<sub>k</sub>=t)</i> is a path
from the starting vertex, <i>x<sub>j</sub></i> is the top of the queue and
<i>x<sub>j+1</sub>,...,x<sub>k</sub></i> are not visited, then <i>x<sub>j+1</sub></i>
is added to the queue and is followed only by non-visited vertices.
</p><p>
If, though, a vertex <i>x<sub>l</sub></i>, with <i>l&gt;j</i>, is added to the visited set,
it is also added to the queue and is followed only by non-visited vertices.

</p><h2>Minimum length path - proof of correctness</h2>
<p>
Note that <tt>dist</tt> contains the length of the path that would be retrieved
from the <tt>prev</tt> map.
</p><p>
First, we remark that vertices are processed in groups with increasing values of
<tt>dist</tt>. That is, first we process the start vertex that has a <tt>dist</tt>
of 0, and the algorithm puts vertices with a <tt>dist</tt> of 1 in the queue.
Then they are processed and the vertices put in the queue will have a <tt>dist</tt>
of 2, then the vertices with <tt>dist</tt>=2 are processed and vertices with
<tt>dist</tt>=3 are put into the queue, and so on
</p>
<p>
Next, we prove that if <tt>dist[x]=k</tt>, then there exists a walk of length <tt>k</tt>
from start to <tt>x</tt>. This can be proven by indunction on the iterations. Initially,
we have a zero length walk from start to itself. Next, when we set <tt>dist</tt>
for a vertex, it is set based on a previous vertex, as <tt>dist[y]=dist[x]+1</tt>.
By induction hypothesis, there is a walk of length <tt>dist[x]</tt> from start to
<tt>x</tt> and, by adding the edge <tt>(x,y)</tt> to it, we get a walk of length
<tt>dist[x]+1</tt> from start to <tt>y</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we will prove that <tt>dist[x]</tt> is indeed the length of the minimum length
walk from start to <tt>x</tt>. Suppose
<i>(s=x<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>1</sub>,...,x<sub>k</sub>)</i> is a minimum length walk
from <i>s</i> to some vertex <i>x<sub>k</sub></i>. We claim that
<tt>dist[</tt><i>x<sub>i</sub></i><tt>]</tt>=<i>i</i>, for all vertices in the walk.
Let <i>i</i> be the first vertex for which the  claim is false. It means that,
when <i>x<sub>i-1</sub></i> was processed, <i>x<sub>i</sub></i> was already processed
(otherwise it would have got assigned a <tt>dist</tt> of <i>i</i>). But this means
that it got an even smaller value (<tt>dist[</tt><i>x<sub>i</sub></i><tt>]</tt>&lt;<i>i</i>),
which means that there is a strictly better walk to <i>x<sub>i</sub></i>, which
contradicts our assumption.
