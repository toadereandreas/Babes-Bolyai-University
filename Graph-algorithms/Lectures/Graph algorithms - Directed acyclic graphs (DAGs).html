<h1><center>Graph algorithms - Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)</center></h1>

<h2>Basics</h2>
<p> A <i>directed acyclic graph</i> (DAG) is a directed graph having no cycle.</p>

<p>Directed acyclic graphs are often used for representing dependency relations,
for example:</p><ul>
  <li>vertices are activities in a project, and an edge <i>(x,y)</i> means that
    activity <i>y</i> cannot start before activity <i>x</i> is completed (because
    <i>y</i> depends on the end product of <i>x</i>);
  </li><li>vertices are topics in a book, and an edge <i>(x,y)</i> means that topic <i>y</i>
    cannot be understood without first understanding topic <i>x</i>;
  </li><li>vertices are computation steps or computation results, and an edge <i>(x,y)</i>
    means that computing <i>y</i> takes as inputs the result for <i>x</i>.
</li></ul><p></p>

<h2>Topological sorting</h2>

<p>Often, when dependency relations are involved, the following two problems need to be
solved:</p><ol>
  <li>Find if there is any circular dependency (in other words, if the dependency graph
    is a DAG or not);
  </li><li>Put the items in an order compatible with the dependency restrictions, that is,
    put the vertices in a list such that whenever there is an edge <i>(x,y)</i>,
    then <i>x</i> comes before <i>y</i> in that list.
</li></ol><p></p>

<p>The latter problem is called <i>topological sorting</i>. Note that the solution
is not, generally, unique.</p>

<p>Finding if a directed graph has cycles or not is done while attempting to do the topological sorting.</p>

<p><b>Property:</b> Topological sorting is possible, for a directed graph, if and only if
there are no cycles in the graph.</p>

<p>If a graph has a cycle, then it is obvious that topologically sorting it is impossible:
Suppose we have a topological sorting,
and let <i>x</i> be the first vertex from the cycle that appears in the topological
sorting. Then, let <i>y</i> be the preceeding vertex in that cycle; we have the edge
<i>(y,x)</i>, but <i>y</i> comes after <i>x</i> in the topological sorting, which is not
allowed.</p>

<p>For proving the other way round, we use the construction algorithms below. We'll prove
that neither one fails unless there is a cycle in the input graph.</p>

<h3>Predecessor counting algorithm</h3>

<p>The ideea is the following: we take a vertex with no predecessors, we put it on the
sorted list, and we eliminate it from the graph. Then, we take a vertex with no predecessors
from the remaining graph and continue the same way.</p>

<p>Finally, we either process all vertices
and end up with the topologically sorted list, or we cannot get a vertex with
no predecessors, which means we have a cycle. Indeed, if, at some point, we cannot
get a vertex with no predecessors, we can prove that the remaining graph at that point
has a cycle. Take a vertex, take one of its predecessors (at least one exists), take a
predecessor of its, and so on, obtaining an infinite sequence. But the set of vertices
is finite, so, we must have repeating vertices, i., e., a cycle.</p>

<p>It remains to get an efficient way to implement finding vertices with no
predecessors and removing them from the graph. Here, the idea is to not actually remove
vertices, but to keep, for each vertex, a counter of predecessors still in the graph.
The algorithm follows:</p>

<pre>Input:
    G : directed graph
Output:
    sorted : a list of vertices in topological sorting order, or null if G has cycles
Algorithm:
    sorted = emptyList
    Queue q
    Dictionary count
    for x in X do
        count[x] = indeg(x)
        if count[x] == 0 then
            q.enqueue(x)
        endif
    endfor
    while not q.isEmpty() do
        x = q.dequeue()
        sorted.append(x)
        for y in Nout(x) do
            count[y] = count[y] - 1
            if count[y] == 0 then
                q.enqueue(y)
            endif
        endfor
    endwhile
    if sorted.size() &lt; X.size() then
        sorted = null
    endif
</pre>

<h3>Depth-first search based algorithm</h3>

<p>This is based on the Murphy's law <i>whatever you're starting to do, you realize
something else should have been done first.</i> Only that, when we discover that,
we do that something and, finally, do our activity. This leads to the following simplified
algorithm:</p>
<pre>do(x):
    for y in Nin(x)
        if y not yet done then
            do(y)
        endif
    endfor
    actually do x
</pre>

<p>Performing the above requires:</p><ul>
  <li>a list where to store vertices on <i>actually do x</i>;
  </li><li>a fast way to verify if an activity was performed (this would be a set with the same
      content as the sorted list, but with quicker access by value);
  </li><li>a way to detect cyclic dependencies; for this, we will detect whenever performing
      <i>do(x)</i> invokes again <i>do(x)</i> before doing <i>actually do x</i>.
</li></ul><p></p>

<p>The result is:</p>

<pre>Input:
    G : directed graph
Output:
    sorted : a list of vertices in topological sorting order, or null if G has cycles
Subalgotithm TopoSortDFS(Graph G, Vertex x, List sorted, Set fullyProcessed, Set inProcess)
    inProcess.add(x)
    for y in Nin(x)
        if y in inProcess then
            return false
        else if y not in fullyProcessed then
            ok = TopoSortDFS(G, y, sorted, fullyProcessed, inProcess)
            if not ok then
                return false
            endif
        endif
    endfor
    inProcess.remove(x)
    sorted.append(x)
    fullyProcessed.add(x)
    return true

Algorithm:
    sorted = emptyList
    fullyProcess = emptySet
    inProcess = emptySet
    for x in X do
        if x not in fullyProcessed then
            ok = TopoSortDFS(G, x, sorted, fullyProcessed, inProcess)
            if not ok then
                sorted = null
                return
            endif
        endif
    endfor
</pre>


<h2>DAGs, strongly connected components, and preorder relations</h2>

<p><b>Property:</b> A directed graph is a DAG if and only if it has no loops and each
of its strongly connected components consists in a single vertex.</p>

<p>Proof: A DAG obviously cannot have loops. In addition, if there are two distinct vertices
<i>x</i> and <i>y</i> in the same strongly connected component (SCC), then there is a path
from <i>x</i> to <i>y</i> and a path from <i>y</i> to <i>x</i> and those paths together
form a cycle; therefore, in a DAG, any SCC can have at most 1 vertex. For the other way
round, let's prove that a graph with no loops and with only 1-vertex SCCs is DAG. Suppose
the contrary, that we have a cycle. If the cycle has length 1, it is a loop. If the cycle
is longer, it has at least 2 vertices, which lie in the same SCC.
Thus, we have a contradiction.</p>

<p>Note the similarity between the topological sorting DFS-based algorthm and the
algorithm for determining the SCCs. This is not a coincidence and, moreover,
the SCC algorithm finds the SCC in a topological order, in the
<i>condensed graph</i> defined below.</p>

<p>Given a graph <i>G</i> that may have cycles, we can construct the <i>condensed graph
G'</i> as follows: each SCC of <i>G</i> appears as a vertex of <i>G'</i>, and we put an
edge <i>(A, B)</i> in <i>G'</i> if and only if there is at least an edge in <i>G</i> between
a vertex of component <i>A</i> and a vertex of component <i>B</i>.</p>

<p>It is easy to see that <i>G'</i> is a DAG. Moerover, the SCC algorithm determines
the SCCs in a topological order with respect to <i>G'</i>.</p>
